## Latest News

* Minerva now evolves to use cudnn_v2. Please download and use the new [library](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuDNN).

## Overview

Minerva is a fast and flexible tool for deep learning. It provides NDarray programming interface, just like Numpy. Python bindings and C++ bindings are both available. The resulting code can be run on CPU or GPU. Multi-GPU support is very easy. Please refer to the examples to see how multi-GPU setting is used.Minerva is a fast and flexible tool for deep learning.
